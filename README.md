# MovePeople-A2B

Just a funny JS-script that solves the problem of how to move people from the house A to the house B in a rainy weather if there is only one unbrella. Not more than 2 people could go under the umbrella. Each person has its own time for the walk from A to B, and a pair walks from A to B during the time of the slowest person. What would be the least time required and what would be the squence of moves?

This script analyses all possible combination with the assunption that the fastest person from the house B returns unbrella to A.
